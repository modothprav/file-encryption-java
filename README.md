## Java File Encryptor 

The Objective of this project was to learn how to use the Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) to perform symmetric file encryption and decryption. Additionally password-based encryption and implementation for changes in recommended key lengths and algorithms were also added. 

## Folder Structure

The project contains two folders 

- `src`: the folder has the FileEncryptor.java where majority of the project functionality resides and a Util.java file with some utility fuctions.
- `resources`: this folder is used to store all the input and output files i.e. the plaintext and ciphertext files.
